# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Linear regression to Predict MPG
* Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
    *   Variables vehicle_weight, spoiler_angle, and, amd AWD provided the a non-random amoint of variance.
* Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
    * The slop of the line is not considered to be 0. Since there is a signifcant relations between the independent variavles and the dependent variable, the slope will not be 0.
* Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
    * This linear model does predict the mpg of MechaCar' prototypes effecitvely because the r'sqaured value is greater the above 0.7 as it is 0.71 and the p-value is signicantly less that 0.05.

### Analysis of summary statistics on the Pounds per square inch(PSI)

* For the total summmary, the variance is high overall and the standard deviation is very far from the mean. This conveys that the design specification for all the manufacturing lots in total is not being met. 

* The summary statistics for each individual manufacutring highlights that Lot3  is where a majority of the high variance and standard deviation are coming from for the total. Lot 1 is meeting the the design specification the best out of the 3 lots while Lot2 is second place. There must be improvements made for the Lot2 and Lot3 for the vehicles to mimic Lot1 production design for there to be conistent manufacturing in regards to suspension coils.
