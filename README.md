# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Linear regression to Predict MPG
* Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
    *   Variables vehicle_weight, spoiler_angle, and, amd AWD provided the a non-random amoint of variance.
* Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
    * The slop of the line is not considered to be 0. Since there is a signifcant relations between the independent variavles and the dependent variable, the slope will not be 0.
* Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
    * This linear model does predict the mpg of MechaCar' prototypes effecitvely because the r'sqaured value is greater the above 0.7 as it is 0.71 and the p-value is signicantly less that 0.05.
